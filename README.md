## Context & Objective

### Context
Predictive algorithms serve multiple functions in criminal justice. COMPAS is a prominent risk assessment tool used since 1998 in the US. In 2016, ProPublica highlighted significant biases in the COMPAS Algorithm.

### Objective(s)
The main objective is to understand that **the data itself is biased**. Implement your own recidivism prediction algorithms and measure their fairness.
